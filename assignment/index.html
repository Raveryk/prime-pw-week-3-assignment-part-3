      <ol>
        <li>I am wondering if how I wrote my console.logs for the negative array values in Qs 6, 7, & 8 would be incorrect (or at least not optimum) because they aren't outputting as blue in the console (number value) but instead were concatenated into the string?</li>
        <li>I also was trying to make sense of why my second conditional within the loops in Qs 6, 7, & 8 seemed to only work if I used another if statement or an 'else if' but not if I just used an 'else'?</li>
        <li>Lastly, I'm curious if how I wrote the code block in Q6 - creating a variable for for the array index (let x = supplyChanges[i]) is useful or if there are some unforseen problems that that might create?</li>
      </ol>
